> A harmonica gun or slide gun  is a form of firearm which was breech loaded
> with a steel slide, containing a number of chambers bored in it and which were
> filled with projectiles. Most harmonica guns are percussion cap guns, although
> some designs exist for compressed air guns and some examples were made in
> pinfire cartridge form. In percussion cap guns, each chamber contains a
> separate primer, powder charge, and projectile. The slide was inserted in an
> opening in the breech action and could be advanced by releasing the camlock,
> moving the slide by hand. The gun comes in both pistol and rifle models, as
> well as single-action and double-action. The earliest example of a harmonica
> gun is probably the one constructed by the Swiss inventor Welten in
> 1742.According to Clive Scott Chisholm in Following the Wrong God Home:
> Footloose in an American Dream and Louis A Garavaglia & Charles G. Worman in
> Firearms of the American West: 1803-1865 the slide gun was independently
> invented by a Mormon gunsmith called Nicanor Kendall in 1838 and it was from
> this gunsmith that Browning got the idea for his own harmonica guns when he
> moved to the area in which Kendall was living in around 1840.The most famous
> maker of harmonica guns was Jonathan Browning, father of John Moses Browning.
> Commencing in 1834 in Quincy, Illinois, he began to make harmonica guns and
> more conventional revolving rifles. He continued to improve on the principle
> after he became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
> and emigrated to Nauvoo, Illinois, and finally Ogden, Utah. In 1837 a
> percussion cap harmonica gun was patented by Elijah Fisher and Dexter H.
> Chamberlain.In 1854 a pump action harmonica gun was patented by Alexander
> Bain.A crank-operated harmonica gun was patented in 1856 by C G Terrel.
