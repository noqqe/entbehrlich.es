Es gibt auch virtuelle Pandemien

> The Corrupted Blood incident was a virtual pandemic in the MMORPG World of
> Warcraft, which began on September 13, 2005, and lasted for one week. The
> epidemic began with the introduction of the new raid Zul'Gurub and its end
> boss Hakkar the Soulflayer. When confronted and attacked, Hakkar would cast a
> hit point-draining and highly contagious debuff spell called "Corrupted Blood"
> on players. The spell, intended to last only seconds and function only within
> the new area of Zul'Gurub, soon spread across the virtual world by way of an
> oversight that allowed pets and minions to take the affliction out of its
> intended confines. By both accidental and purposeful intent, a pandemic ensued
> that quickly killed lower-level characters and drastically changed normal
> gameplay, as players did what they could do to avoid infection. Despite
> measures such as programmer-imposed quarantines, and the players' abandoning
> of densely populated cities (or even just not playing the game), it lasted
> until a combination of patches and resets of the virtual world finally
> controlled the spread. The conditions and reactions of the event attracted the
> attention of epidemiologists for its implications of how human populations
> could react to a real-world epidemic.
