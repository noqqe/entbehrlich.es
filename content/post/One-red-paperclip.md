> One red paperclip is a website created by Canadian blogger Kyle MacDonald, who
> bartered his way from a single red paperclip to a house in a series of
> fourteen online trades over the course of a year. MacDonald was inspired by
> the childhood game Bigger, Better. His site received a considerable amount of
> notice for tracking the transactions. "A lot of people have been asking how
> I've stirred up so much publicity around the project, and my simple answer is:
> 'I have no idea'", he told the BBC.
