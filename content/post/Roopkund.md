An diesem See sind auf mysteriÃ¶se Weise ca 300 Menschen verstorben

> Roopkund (locally known as Mystery Lake or Skeletons Lake) is a high altitude
> glacial lake in the Uttarakhand state of India. It lies in the lap of Trishul
> massif. Located in the Himalayas, the area around the lake is uninhabited and
> is roughly at an altitude of 16,470 feet (5,020 m), surrounded by rock-strewn
> glaciers and snow-clad mountains. Roopkund is a popular trekking
> destination.With a depth of about 3 metres, Roopkund is widely known for the
> hundreds of ancient human skeletons found at the edge of the lake. The human
> skeletal remains are visible at its bottom when the snow melts. Research
> generally points to a semi-legendary event where a group of people was killed
> in a sudden, violent hailstorm in the 9th century. Because of the human
> remains, the lake has been called Skeleton Lake in recent times.
