Kunst die keinen Sinn macht. Aber zum Denken anregt und somit beste Kunst.

> "Cow Tools" is a cartoon from Gary Larson's The Far Side, published in October
> of 1982. It depicts a cow standing in front of a table of bizarre, misshapen
> implements with the caption "Cow tools." The cartoon confused many readers,
> who wrote or phoned in seeking an explanation of the joke. In response to the
> controversy, Larson issued a press release clarifying that the thrust of the
> cartoon was simply that, if a cow were to make tools, they would "lack
> something in sophistication." It has been described as "the most loathed Far
> Side strip ever."
