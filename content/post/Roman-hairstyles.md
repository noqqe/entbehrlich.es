Römische Büsten hatten teils austauschbare "Perücken". Vermutlich damit man
nicht jedes Mal eine neue Büste anfertigen lassen muss, wenn sich die
Haarmode mal wieder geändert hat.

> Hairstyle fashion in Rome was ever changing, and particularly in the Roman
> Imperial Period there were a number of different ways to style hair. As with
> clothes, there were several hairstyles that were limited to certain people in
> ancient society. Styles are so distinctive they allow scholars today to create
> a chronology of Roman portraiture and art; we are able to date pictures of the
> empresses on coins, or identify busts depending on their hairstyles.
