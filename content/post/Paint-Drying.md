Raiting von 9,3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5375100/) bekommen!

> Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or mastic composition that, after
> application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film. It is
> most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects. Paint can
> be made or purchased in many colors—and in many different types, such as
> watercolor, synthetic, etc. Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a
> liquid, but most types dry into a solid.
