Mord(?) beim Schlafwandeln

> Homicidal sleepwalking, also known as homicidal somnambulism or sleepwalking
> murder, is the act of killing someone during an episode of sleepwalking. There
> have been some cases in which an act of homicide has occurred and the prime
> suspect may have committed the act while sleepwalking. The veracity of
> recorded cases is disputed. About 69 cases had been reported in the literature
> up to the year 2005. One such case is that of Kenneth Parks, who was acquitted
> of the murder of his mother-in-law in 1987 after using the sleepwalking
> defense.
