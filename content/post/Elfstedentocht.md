Ein grandioser Artikel mit jeder Menge Trivia über ein 200km langes
Schlittschuhrennen in den Niederlanden

> The Elfstedentocht (Dutch pronunciation: [ɛlf'steːdə(n)tɔxt];  West Frisian:
> Alvestêdetocht [ɔlvəˈstɛːdətɔχt], English: Eleven cities tour) is a long-
> distance tour skating event on natural ice, almost 200 kilometres (120 mi)
> long, which is held both as a speed skating competition (with 300 contestants)
> and a leisure tour (with 16,000 skaters). It is held in the province of
> Friesland in the north of the Netherlands, leading past all eleven historical
> cities of the province. The tour is held at most once a year, only when the
> natural ice along the entire course is at least 15 centimetres (6 in) thick;
> sometimes on consecutive years, other times with gaps that may exceed 20
> years. When the ice is suitable, the tour is announced and starts within 48
> hours.
