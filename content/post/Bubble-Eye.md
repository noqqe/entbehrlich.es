Hamster als Fische

> The Bubble Eye is a small variety of fancy goldfish   with upward-pointing
> eyes that are accompanied by two large fluid-filled sacs. It is a dorsal-less
> fish â€“ good specimens will have a clean back and eye bubbles that match in
> color and size. Their bubbles are quite delicate, so the fish should be kept
> separately from boisterous types, as well as sharp tank decor. Although the
> bubbles will regrow if punctured, an injury could leave the fish prone to
> infections. The bubbles can disadvantage the fish as it is not a strong
> swimmer, with a seemingly low bobbing head at times; bubbles are infamous for
> being sucked into filters and siphons in an aquarium.
