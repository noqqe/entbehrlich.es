Fallschrimsprung zu langweilig? BitteschÃ¶n.

> Extreme ironing (also called EI) is an extreme sport in which people take
> ironing boards to remote locations and iron items of clothing.  According to
> the Extreme Ironing Bureau, extreme ironing is "the latest danger sport that
> combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a
> well-pressed shirt."Part of the attraction and interest the media has shown
> towards extreme ironing seems to center on the issue of whether it is really a
> sport or not. It is widely considered to be tongue-in-cheek.Some other
> locations where such performances have taken place include a mountainside of a
> difficult climb; a forest; in a canoe; while skiing or snowboarding; on top of
> large bronze statues; in the middle of a street; underwater; in the middle of
> the M1 motorway; race;  whilst parachuting; and under the ice sheet of a
> frozen lake.  The performances have been conducted solo or by groups.
