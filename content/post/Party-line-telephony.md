> subscribers.Party line systems were widely used to provide telephone service,
> starting with the first commercial switchboards in 1878. A majority of Bell
> System subscribers in the mid-20th century in the United States and Canada
> were serviced by party lines, which carried a billing discount over individual
> service; during wartime shortages, these were often the only available lines.
> British users similarly benefited from the party line discount. Farmers in
> rural Australia and South Africa used party lines, where a single line spanned
> miles from the nearest town to one property and on to the next.
