Ein Schloss mit Einbruchsdetektor

> A Chubb detector lock is a type of lever tumbler lock with an integral
> security feature, a form of relocker, which frustrates unauthorised access
> attempts and indicates to the lock's owner that it has been interfered with.
> When someone tries to pick the lock or to open it using the wrong key, the
> lock is designed to jam in a locked state until (depending on the lock) either
> a special regulator key or the original key is inserted and turned in a
> different direction. This alerts the owner to the fact that the lock has been
> tampered with. Any person who attempts to pick a detector lock must avoid
> triggering the automatic jamming mechanism. If the automatic jamming mechanism
> is accidentally triggered (which happens when any one of the levers is lifted
> too high) the lock-picker has the additional problem of resetting the detector
> mechanism before their next attempt to open the lock. This introduces
> additional complexity into the task which slows the process down
> significantly, thereby increasing the degree of lock-picking skill required to
> a level which very few people would have. The first detector lock was produced
> in 1818 by Jeremiah Chubb of Portsmouth, England, as the result of a
> Government competition to create an unpickable lock. It remained unpicked
> until the Great Exhibition of 1851.
