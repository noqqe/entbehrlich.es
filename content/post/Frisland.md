Frisland ist ein

> The Frisians are a West Germanic ethnic group indigenous to the coastal parts
> of the Netherlands and northwestern Germany. They inhabit an area known as
> Frisia and are concentrated in the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen
> and, in Germany, East Frisia and North Frisia (which was a part of Denmark
> until 1864). The Frisian languages are still spoken by more than 500,000
> people; West Frisian is officially recognised in the Netherlands (in
> Friesland), and North Frisian and Saterland Frisian are recognised as regional
> languages in Germany.
