Du entwickelst einen Algorithmus der so viel Daten braucht, dass er niemals
zur Anwendung kommt.

> A galactic algorithm is one that outperforms any other algorithm for problems
> that are sufficiently large, but where "sufficiently large" is so big that the
> algorithm is never used in practice.  Galactic algorithms were so named by
> Richard Lipton and Ken Regan, as they will never be used on any of the merely
> terrestrial data sets we find here on Earth.
