Eine Kurzgeschichte von Herrn Hemingway.

> "For sale: baby shoes, never worn." is the entirety of what has been described
> as a six-word novel, making it an extreme example of what is called flash
> fiction or sudden fiction. Although it is often attributed to Ernest
> Hemingway, the link to him is unsubstantiated and similar stories predate him.
