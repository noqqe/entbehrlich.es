Ein mechanisches Pferd um den italienischen Faschismus voranzubringen.
Wir sind froh, das Panzerpferd nicht gesehen zu haben...


> The iron Dobbin was a mechanical horse which was first described in Popular
> Science Monthly in April 1933. The machine, designed by an Italian inventor,
> was powered by a gasoline engine and moved upon steel pipes allowing it to
> traverse a rough field. The device was to be used to train the youth of the
> GioventÃ¹ Italiana del Littorio to ride, but was rejected by the Italian
> military as impractical.The German military, after seeing the iron Dobbin in
> Popular Science, designed the Panzerpferd for their Gebirgsjaeger troops,
> which was also rejected.
