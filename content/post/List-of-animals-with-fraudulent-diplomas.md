Eine Liste von Tieren die einen akademischen Grad besitzen.

> This list of animals with fraudulent diplomas includes nonhuman animals who
> have been submitted as applicants to suspected diploma mills, and have gotten
> a diploma, despite not achieving academic success.  On occasion, they have
> been admitted and granted a degree, despite not doing any classes, as reported
> in reliable sources. Animals are often used as a device to clearly demonstrate
> the lax standards of the awarding institutions. In one case, a cat's degree
> helped lead to a successful fraud prosecution against the institution that had
> issued it. On occasion, accredited institutions may have awarded mock degrees
> to animals for humorous purposes (e.g. UNSW awarded a dogtorate, not
> doctorate, degree to a dog); such cases are not included below.
