Wenn ihr mal wieder nicht wisst was ihr essen sollt: Ziegenkäse mit lebenden
Larven ist auf Sardinien total hip.

> Casu martzu (Sardinian pronunciation: [ˈkazu ˈmaɾtsu]; literally
> 'rotten/putrid cheese'), also called casu modde, casu cundídu and casu fràzigu
> in Sardinian, is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese that contains live
> insect larvae (maggots). A variation of the cheese, casgiu merzu, is also
> produced in some Southern Corsican villages.Derived from pecorino, casu martzu
> goes beyond typical fermentation to a stage of decomposition, brought about by
> the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly of the Piophilidae
> family. These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese, promoting an
> advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese's fats. The
> texture of the cheese becomes very soft, with some liquid (called làgrima,
> Sardinian for "teardrop") seeping out. The larvae themselves appear as
> translucent white worms, roughly 8 mm (0.3 in) long.
