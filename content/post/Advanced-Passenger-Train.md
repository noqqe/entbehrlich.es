> The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was a tilting high speed train developed by
> British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, for use on the West Coast Main
> Line (WCML). The WCML contained many curves, and the APT pioneered the concept
> of active tilting to address these, a feature that has since been copied on
> designs around the world.
