Der Drehteller beim Chinesen heißt Lazy Susan

> A lazy Susan is a turntable (rotating tray) placed on a table or countertop to
> aid in distributing food. Lazy Susans may be made from a variety of materials
> but are usually glass, wood, or plastic. They are circular and placed in the
> center of a table to share dishes easily among diners. Although they are
> common in Chinese restaurants, the lazy Susan is a Western invention. Owing to
> the nature of Chinese cuisine, especially dim sum, they are common at formal
> Chinese restaurants both in mainland China and abroad. In Chinese, they are
> known as 餐桌转盘 (t. 餐桌轉盤) (p cānzhuō zhuànpán) or "dinner-table turntables".
