Mosquitos töten, mit Lasern! Mit dem Photonic Fence können bis zu 30 Mücken
pro Sekunde getötet werden.

> The mosquito laser is a device invented by astrophysicist Lowell Wood to kill
> large numbers of mosquitoes to reduce malaria infection rates. Although
> originally introduced in the early 1980s, the idea was not substantially
> researched until decades later. In 2007, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
> requested Intellectual Ventures LLC to find a way to fight and eventually end
> malaria. Intellectual Ventures resurrected the idea of using lasers to kill
> mosquitoes and now has a working prototype. The idea has been criticized
> because most areas where malaria is prevalent do not have reliable electrical
> power.
