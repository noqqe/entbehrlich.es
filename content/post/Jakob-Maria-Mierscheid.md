Imaginäres Mitglied des Bundestags, ausgedacht von der SPD.

> Jakob Maria Mierscheid MdB has been a fictitious politician in the German
> Bundestag since 11 December 1979. He was the alleged deputy chairman of the
> Mittelstandsausschuss (Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) of the
> Bundestag in 1981 and 1982. According to his official biography, he was born
> in Morbach/Hunsrück, a very rural constituency in Rhineland-Palatinate. He is
> Catholic and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Jakob
> Mierscheid was "born" on 11 December 1979 on the back of a menu in the
> restaurant of the Bundestag, when two members of parliament from the SPD,
> Peter Würtz and Karl Haehser, decided that their recently deceased colleague
> Carlo Schmid needed a worthy successor. He is now a widely known curiosity
> within the Bundestag and uses Twitter as means of communication.In 1983 the
> party magazine Vorwärts published an article purportedly written by Mierscheid
> claiming the discovery of a "law", the Mierscheid Law, that indicated a strong
> correlation between the election results of the SPD in national elections and
> West German steel production.  The Bundestag official web site carries an
> ostensibly serious 'biography' and a photograph purporting to depict
> Mierscheid. In previous versions of the photograph his fashion sense seemed
> very antiquated and his eyeglasses were added later. The current (2010) image
> shows a balding man sitting in a chair, facing away from the camera, in the
> middle of the empty Hall of Representatives. The German language version of
> the site lists 615 current names although the actual membership of the
> Bundestag is only 614, while the English and French language versions only
> list the actual membership of the Bundestag. Mierscheid has his own stationery
> and e-mail address and issues press releases now and then. The picture of
> Mierscheid at the Bundestag is based on the RTL Samstag Nacht character Karl
> Ranseier.The hoax is paralleled in Germany in a number of other areas, for
> example Friedrich Gottlob Nagelmann is a known (fictional) lawyer and Edmund
> Friedemann Dräcker is a known (fictional) diplomat. Mierscheid, Nagelmann, and
> Dräcker each have a long list of publications which have sometimes really been
> published in otherwise reputable media (science journals, parliament press).
