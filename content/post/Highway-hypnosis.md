> Highway hypnosis, also known as white line fever, is an altered mental state
> in which a person can drive a car, truck, or other automobile great distances,
> responding to external events in the expected, safe, and correct manner with
> no recollection of having consciously done so. In this state, the driver's
> conscious mind is apparently fully focused elsewhere, while seemingly still
> processing the information needed to drive safely. Highway hypnosis is a
> manifestation of the common process of automaticity.The concept was first
> described in a 1921 article that mentioned the phenomenon of "road hypnotism":
> driving in a trance-like state while gazing at a fixed point. A 1929 study,
> Sleeping with the Eyes Open by Walter Miles, also dealt with the subject,
> suggesting that it was possible for motorists to fall asleep with their eyes
> open and continuing to steer. The idea that the unaccountable automobile
> accidents could be explained by this phenomenon became popular in the 1950s.
> The term "highway hypnosis" was coined by G. W. Williams in 1963. Building on
> the theories of Ernest Hilgard (1986, 1992) that hypnosis is an altered state
> of awareness, some theorists hold that the consciousness can develop hypnotic
> dissociation. In the example of highway hypnosis, one stream of consciousness
> is driving the car while the other is dealing with other matters.  Partial or
> complete amnesia related to the time spent driving under highway hypnosis can
> develop for the driver involved.
