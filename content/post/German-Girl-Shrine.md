Unbekanntes deutsches MÃ¤dchen bekommt Schrein in Singapur

> The German Girl Shrine is a shrine on the island of Pulau Ubin in Singapore.
> It marks the site of the burial of an unknown 18-year-old girl who died on the
> island in 1914 after falling from a cliff while fleeing from British forces
> who sought to detain a number of German nationals then resident on the island.
> Her body was recovered and interred in an urn on the site by Chinese workers,
> and a makeshift shrine structure was built. The site was visited frequently by
> gamblers who thought the spirit of the girl would bring them good luck. A
> permanent structure was erected in 1974 by a company carrying out quarrying on
> the island. Quarrying has since ceased, and the shrine is now within Ketam
> Mountain Bike Park. Visitors often leave offerings, including makeup and
> Barbie dolls, at the site.
