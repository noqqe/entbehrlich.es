Well, I'm fucked.

> Witzelsucht (German: [ˈvɪtsl̩ˌzʊxt] "joking addiction") is a set of pure and
> rare neurological symptoms characterized by a tendency to make puns, or tell
> inappropriate jokes or pointless stories in socially inappropriate situations.
> It makes one unable to read sarcasm. A less common symptom is hypersexuality,
> the tendency to make sexual comments at inappropriate times or situations.
> Patients do not understand that their behavior is abnormal, therefore are
> nonresponsive to others' reactions. This disorder is most commonly seen in
> patients with frontal lobe damage, particularly right frontal lobe tumors or
> trauma. The disorder remains named in accordance with its reviewed definition
> by German neurologist Hermann Oppenheim; its first description as the less
> focused moria (pathologic giddiness or lunatic mood) by German neurologist
> Moritz Jastrowitz, was in 1888.
