Wenn du ein Problem laut aussprichst kannst du es oft einfach selbst lÃ¶sen.

> In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code.
> The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in
> which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by
> forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms
> exist for this technique, often involving different (usually) inanimate
> objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat.  Many programmers have had the
> experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone
> who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the
> process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to
> do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two
> becomes apparent. More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation
> from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding. By using
> an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having
> to interrupt anyone else.
