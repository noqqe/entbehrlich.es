Keine Chinesen in der NASA!

> Due to security concerns and various other motivations, US government
> prohibits all researchers from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
> Administration (NASA) from working bilaterally with Chinese citizens
> affiliated with a Chinese state enterprise or entity. In April 2011, the 112th
> United States Congress banned NASA from using its funds to host Chinese
> visitors at NASA facilities. In October 2013, NASA reversed the previous ban
> on working with Chinese scientists, so long as they did not represent their
> government in any official capacity
