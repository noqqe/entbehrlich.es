> Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: "Any headline that ends
> in a question mark can be answered by the word no." It is named after Ian
> Betteridge, a British technology journalist who wrote about it in 2009,
> although the principle is much older. Like similar "laws" (e.g., Murphy's
> law), it is intended to be humorous rather than the literal truth. The adage
> fails to make sense with questions that are more open-ended than strict yes–no
> questions.The maxim has been cited by other names since 1991, when a published
> compilation of Murphy's Law variants called it "Davis's law", a name that also
> crops up online (such as cited by linguist Mark Liberman), without any
> explanation of who Davis was. It has also been referred to as the
> "journalistic principle" and in 2007 was referred to in commentary as "an old
> truism among journalists".
