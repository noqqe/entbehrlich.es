Einmal um 90 Grad drehen bitte!

> The AT&T Building is a high rise located at 240 North Meridian Street in
> Indianapolis, Indiana. It was opened in 1932 and is 22 stories tall. It is
> primarily used for office space and is the headquarters for AT&T in Indiana.
> The AT&T Building is connected with the AT&T 220 Building, which is located
> just to the south. The building has been expanded and has achieved its present
> form only after a few iterations.  The headquarters building previously at
> this site was completed in 1907. In 1930, Indiana Bell moved the building to
> make way for the new construction. Over a 34-day period, the 11,000-short-ton
> (10,000 t) building was shifted 52 feet (16 m) south, rotated 90 degrees, and
> then shifted again 100 feet (30 m) west. This was done without interrupting
> customer telephone service or telephone business operations. The new
> headquarters was completed in 1932, and was 7 stories tall. It was later
> expanded in the 1940s and 1960s to bring it to its current size and height.
> The original building that had been moved was demolished in 1963.
