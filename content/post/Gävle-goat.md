> The Gävle Goat (Swedish: Gävlebocken, Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjɛ̌ːvlɛbɔkːɛn])
> is a traditional Christmas display erected annually at Slottstorget (Castle
> Square) in central Gävle, Sweden. It is a giant version of a traditional
> Swedish Yule Goat figure made of straw. It is erected each year by local
> community groups at the beginning of Advent over a period of two days. It has
> been the subject of repeated arson attacks, and, despite security measures and
> the nearby presence of a fire station, the goat has been burned to the ground
> most years since its first appearance in 1966. As of December 2019, the goat
> has been damaged 37 times. Burning the goat is illegal and the Court of Appeal
> stated that the offence should normally carry a 3-month prison sentence as it
> sentenced a 27-year-old man to a suspended sentence and day fines for
> aggravated property damage in 2018.Since 1986 two Yule Goats have been built
> in Gävle: the Gävle Goat by the Southern Merchants and the Yule Goat built by
> the Natural Science Club of the School of Vasa.
