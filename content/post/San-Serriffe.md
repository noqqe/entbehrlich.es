Eine Insel, die es nicht gibt.

> San Serriffe is a fictional island nation invented for April Fools' Day 1977,
> by Britain's Guardian newspaper. It was featured in a seven-page hoax
> supplement, published in the style of contemporary reviews of foreign
> countries, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the island's independence,
> complete with themed advertisements from major companies.  The supplement
> provided an elaborate description of the nation as a tourist destination and
> developing economy, but most of its place names and characters were puns and
> plays on words relating to printing (such as "sans-serif" and names of common
> fonts). The original idea was to place the island in the Atlantic Ocean near
> Tenerife, but because of the ground collision of two Boeing 747s there a few
> days before publication it was moved to the Indian Ocean, near the Seychelles
> Islands. Because of this late move the authors made San Serriffe a moving
> island â€“ a combination of coastal erosion on its west side and deposition on
> the east cause it to move towards Sri Lanka, with which it will eventually
> collide, at about 1.4 km/year. San Serriffe was one of the most famous and
> successful hoaxes of recent decades; it has become part of the common cultural
> heritage of literary humour, and a secondary body of literature has been
> derived from it. The nation was reused for similar hoaxes in 1978, 1980 and
> 1999. In April 2009 the geography, history and culture of San Serriffe
> featured heavily in the paper's cryptic crossword.
