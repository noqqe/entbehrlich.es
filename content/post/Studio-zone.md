> In the American entertainment industry, the studio zone, also known as the
> thirty-mile zone (TMZ), is the area traditionally marked roughly around a
> 30-mile (48 km) radius from the southwest corner of West Beverly Boulevard and
> North La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. It is considered the
> "local area" for the purposes of determining employee benefits. The boundaries
> of the 30-mile radius includes almost all of the southern half of Los Angeles
> County, as well as parts of eastern Ventura County and northwestern Orange
> County.
