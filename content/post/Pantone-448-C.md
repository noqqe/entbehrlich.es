Die hässlichste Farbe der Welt. Amtlich.

> Pantone 448 C, also referred to as "the ugliest colour in the world", is a
> colour in the Pantone colour system. Described as a "drab dark brown", it was
> selected in 2012 as the colour for plain tobacco and cigarette packaging in
> Australia, after market researchers determined that it was the least
> attractive colour.  The Australian Department of Health initially referred to
> the colour as "olive green", but the name was changed after concerns were
> expressed by the Australian Olive Association.Since 2016, the same colour has
> also been used for plain cigarette packaging in many countries, including
> France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Israel, Norway, New Zealand, Slovenia,
> Saudi Arabia, Uruguay, Thailand, Turkey, Belgium and the NetherlandsThe colour
> has also been widely but erroneously reported as being known as "opaque
> couché"; in fact this is simply French for "layered opaque", in reference to
> being used on coated paper. The confusion may have arisen because "PANTONE
> opaque couché" is the French name of a swatch library (palette) used in Adobe
> Illustrator containing this colour and intended for printing in solid ink
> colours on coated paper; in English this library is known as "PANTONE solid
> coated".
