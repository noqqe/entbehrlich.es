Schafe scheren. Nach 6 Jahren. 27kg Wolle.

> Shrek (27 November 1994 – 6 June 2011) was a Merino wether (castrated male
> sheep) belonging to Bendigo Station, a sheep station near Tarras, New Zealand,
> who gained international fame in 2004, after he avoided being caught and shorn
> for six years. Merinos are normally shorn annually, but Shrek apparently hid
> in caves, avoiding muster. He was named after the fictional ogre in books and
> films of the same name.After finally being caught on 15 April 2004, the wether
> was shorn by a professional in 20 minutes on 28 April. The shearing was
> broadcast on national television in New Zealand. His fleece contained enough
> wool to make 20 large men's suits, weighing 27 kg (60 lb) – an average Merino
> fleece weighs around 4.5 kg (10 lb), with exceptional weights up to around 15
> kg (33 lb).Shrek became a national icon. He was taken to parliament to meet
> the then-New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, in May 2004, to celebrate
> his 10th birthday. In November 2006, 30 months after his initial shearing,
> Shrek was shorn again, on an iceberg floating off the coast of Dunedin, New
> Zealand.Shrek was euthanised on 6 June 2011 on a veterinarian's advice. He was
> 16.
