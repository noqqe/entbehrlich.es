Wenn man die nächste Generation eines Produkts zu früh ankündigt, bekommt man
es möglicherweise mit dem Osborne Effekt zu tun.

> The Osborne effect is a social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring
> orders for the current soon-to-be-obsolete product as an unexpected drawback
> of a company's announcing a future product prematurely. The term was coined
> after the Osborne Computer Corporation, a company that took more than a year
> to make its next product available, and eventually went bankrupt in 1983.
