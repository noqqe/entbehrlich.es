Der älteste Mann Japans lebt garnicht mehr. Eine Betrugsgeschichte mit
Folgen.

> Sogen Kato (加藤 宗現, Katō Sōgen, 22 July 1899 – c. November 1978) was a Japanese
> man thought to have been Tokyo's oldest man until July 2010, when his
> mummified corpse was found in his bedroom. It was concluded he had likely died
> in November 1978, aged 79, and his family had never announced his death in an
> attempt to preserve his longevity record. Relatives had rebuffed attempts by
> ward officials to see Kato in preparations for Respect for the Aged Day later
> that year, citing many reasons from him being a "human vegetable" to becoming
> a Sokushinbutsu. The cause of death was not determined due to the state of
> Kato's body.The discovery of Kato's remains sparked a search for other missing
> centenarians lost due to poor record keeping by officials. A study following
> the discovery of Kato's remains found that police did not know if 234,354
> people over the age of one hundred were still alive. Poor record keeping was
> to blame for many of the cases, officials admitted. One of Kato's relatives
> was found guilty of fraud; his relatives claimed ¥9,500,000 (US$117,939;
> £72,030) of pension meant for Kato.
