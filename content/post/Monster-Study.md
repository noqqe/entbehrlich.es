Studien die man heute nicht mehr so machen wÃ¼rde.

> The Monster Study was a stuttering experiment performed on 22 orphan children
> in Davenport, Iowa in 1939. It was conducted by Wendell Johnson at the
> University of Iowa. Graduate student  Mary Tudor conducted the experiment
> under Johnson's supervision. Half of the children received positive speech
> therapy, praising the fluency of their speech, and the other half, negative
> speech therapy, belittling the children for speech imperfections. Many of the
> normal speaking orphan children who received  negative therapy in the
> experiment suffered negative psychological effects, and some retained speech
> problems for the rest of their lives. It was dubbed the "Monster Study" as
> some of Johnson's peers were horrified that he would experiment on orphan
> children to confirm a hypothesis. The experiment was kept hidden for fear
> Johnson's reputation would be tarnished in the wake of human experiments
> conducted by the Nazis during World War II. Because the results of the study
> were never published in any peer-reviewed journal, Tudor's thesis is the only
> official record of the details of the experiment.The University of Iowa
> publicly apologized for the Monster Study in 2001. However, Patricia
> Zebrowski, University of Iowa assistant professor of speech pathology and
> audiology notes that the data that resulted from the experiment is the
> "largest collection of scientific information" on the phenomenon of stuttering
> and that Johnson's work was the first to discuss the importance of the
> stutterer's thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and feelings and continues to
> influence views on stuttering greatly.
