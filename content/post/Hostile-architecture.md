Gegen Obdachlose und Skateboarder :(

> Hostile architecture is an urban-design strategy that uses elements of the
> built environment to purposefully guide or restrict behaviour. It often
> targets people who use or rely on public space more than others, such as youth
> and homeless people, by restricting the physical behaviours they can engage
> in. Also known as defensive architecture, hostile design, unpleasant design,
> exclusionary design, and defensive urban design, the term hostile architecture
> is often associated with "anti-homeless spikes" â€“ studs embedded in flat
> surfaces to make sleeping on them uncomfortable and impractical. Other
> measures include sloped window sills to stop people sitting; benches with
> armrests positioned to stop people lying on them, and water sprinklers that
> "intermittently come on but aren't really watering anything." Hostile
> architecture is also employed to deter skateboarding, littering, loitering,
> and public urination.
