Der unfassbare Aufwand mit dem 1960 Filme gedreht wurden. Wow!

> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) originally announced a remake of the 1925 silent
> film Ben-Hur in December 1952, ostensibly as a way to spend its Italian
> assets. Stewart Granger and Robert Taylor were reported to be in the running
> for the lead. Nine months later, MGM announced it would make the film in
> CinemaScope, with shooting beginning in 1954. In November 1953, MGM announced
> it had assigned producer Sam Zimbalist to the picture and hired screenwriter
> Karl Tunberg to write it. Zimbalist was chosen because he had produced MGM's
> Best Picture-nominated Christians-and-lions epic Quo Vadis in 1951.  The
> studio then announced in July 1954 that production would start in March 1955
> with 42 speaking parts and 97 sets. MGM said Sidney Franklin would direct,
> that the script by Tunberg was finished, that shooting would occur in Rome and
> in Spain, and that Marlon Brando was up for the lead. In September 1955,
> Zimbalist, who continued to claim that Tunberg's script was complete,
> announced that a $7 million, six-to-seven month production would begin in
> April 1956 in either Israel or Egypt in MGM's new 65mm widescreen process.
> MGM, however, suspended production in early 1956.By the late 1950s, court
> decisions forcing film studios to divest themselves of theater chains and the
> competitive pressure of television had caused significant financial distress
> at MGM. In a gamble to save the studio, and inspired by the success of
> Paramount Pictures' 1956 Biblical epic The Ten Commandments, studio head
> Joseph Vogel announced in 1957 that MGM would again move forward on a remake
> of Ben-Hur. Filming started in May 1958 and wrapped in January 1959, and post-
> production took six months. Although the budget for Ben-Hur was initially $7
> million, it was reported to be $10 million by February 1958, reaching $15
> million by the time shooting began—making it the costliest film ever produced
> up to that time. When adjusted for inflation, the budget of Ben Hur was
> approximately $132 million in constant dollars.One notable change in the film
> involved the opening titles. Concerned that a roaring Leo the Lion (the MGM
> mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred nativity
> scene, Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in
> which Leo the Lion is quiet. It was the first time in MGM history that the
> lion logo was not seen roaring.
