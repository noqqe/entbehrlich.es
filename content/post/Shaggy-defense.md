title: Shaggy defense
---

Die Shaggy Defense benutzt man vor Gericht in dem man einfach immer wieder
beteuert "War ich nicht", egal welche Beweise es gibt. Der Name kommt von
einem Lied des KÃ¼nstlers Shaggy "it wasn't me".

> A Shaggy defense is the name given to a legal strategy in which the defendant
> flatly denies guilt in the face of overwhelming evidence against them,
> particularly a recording of them committing the act, just by denying that they
> were the one witnessed or recorded committing the act.
